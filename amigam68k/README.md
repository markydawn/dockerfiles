# Simple AmigaOS M68K image
Hopefully used by me in some Github Actions pipelines for automated releases of my various AmigaOS M68K projects. 


Obviously a great deal of thanks to the guys behind the various Amiga compiler repos and base Docker images <3

Pushed to Docker hub as themkat/amigaosm68k. The work is all thanks to the contributors to the gcc toolchain, I just set up a Docker image to fit my needs.
