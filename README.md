# dockerfiles
Various Docker files for various operations and programs. Inspired by Jessie Frazelle who inspired me to start sharing Dockerfiles :) 


## Containers needing X11/GUI 
You may have to run `xhost +` to make the Docker able to access X11. Found information on it here:

If you would like to lecture me on the dangers of this, please be my guest :) 

Haven't tested GUI applications in Docker on Windows yet.
